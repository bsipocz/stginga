Running stginga with Jupyter/IPython Notebooks
==============================================

.. warning::

    :mod:`~stginga.nbinteract` is deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release.
    Please see `this notebook example provided by Ginga <https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga/blob/master/ginga/examples/jupyter-notebook/Jupyter%20Widget%20Ideas.ipynb>`_ instead.

:mod:`stginga` includes the :mod:`~stginga.nbinteract`, a module to simplify the use of
the ginga viewer inside, or in close association with,
`Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_. The module is
primarily intended to provide a convenience interface to the HTML canvas
backend for ginga in a way that allows interactivity between the viewer and
the python session running in a notebook.

The current functionality in :mod:`~stginga.nbinteract` is focused around setting
up a viewer context and loading data into it.  To see a usage example
demonstrating the current functionality, see
:doc:`This example notebook <notebooks/ginga_nbinteract>`
(which you can get in notebook form from
`the github repository <https://github.com/spacetelescope/stginga/tree/master/docs/stginga/notebooks/ginga_nbinteract.ipynb>`_).
Future improvements are planned to add more convenience features like accessing
ginga regions or marking up images with only a few lines of code.
